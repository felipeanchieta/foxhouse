Description
-----------

This is a final project presented as part of a Computer Graphics class for evaluation.

Here I develop an \*.off visualizer with C++, Qt and GLSL. In order to make this more "visual", I used a model of a house, then this title.

How to run
----------

One may be able to compile this using Qt qmake .pro file, I just do not remember right as I do not maintain this project anymore.
